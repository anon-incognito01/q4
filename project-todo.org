* Project Todo
** TODO Add per data transformations in thread
   same idea as the board and thread, but now for each post in the thread
** TODO Add better inline replies with overlays
** TODO make the buffers read only
   marks and such get messed up if you accidentally type something while browsing
** TODO add thread watching
*** TODO add notifications for changes
    think 4chanx
** TODO more sophisticated search and filtering
   basically regexes
** TODO add posting
   fuck me no documentation
   I fucking hate REST
*** xwidget support
    going to have to use this for the google recaptcha 
** TODO add support for similar *chan boards
   think lainchan, 8chan, etc
   any tinychan ones will be minimal effort, but 8chan has a different api
** TODO mouse support
   click thumbnails to open full sized versions
   hover over for full sized image? is that possible??
** any old ones that haven't been implemented yet
*** TODO extract urls from parenthesis if needed when using list-urls
*** TODO viper-mode support
*** TODO Utilize defcustom where it makes sense.
*** TODO add /t/ magnet support in addition the URLs
     [[https://github.com/skangas/mentor/issues][mentor]] might be dead?, but it's also possible to just call transmission from shell commands
*** TODO set up photo download dir to prompt for full, not relative path when var is set to nil
*** TODO add optional faces for tripcodes, names, dubs/trips/quads/etc..
*** TODO get /pol/ flags centered in the row instead of at the bottom (looks weird af)
*** TODO /pol/ ID support
